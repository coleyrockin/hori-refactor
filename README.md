# hori-refactor 
Refactor this website
Make it meet accessibility standards (ALT for imgs)
Use semantic HTML for OSE (optimized search engine)
Edit the heading (fall in order)
Title concise ( yet descriptive)
Nothing on the website should change besides the code

Organized the code structure on css, took out all the div tags/one span tag, gave imgs descriptions, fixed search engine optimization nav
